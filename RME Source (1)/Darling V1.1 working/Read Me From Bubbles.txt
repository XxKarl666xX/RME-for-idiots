this "Bubbles" guy, is also known as "RainReach". He is a tranny fagg that tries to make people think that he is a woman. Its a chick with a dick that uses a female AI voice on his videos. Dont trust him, he is just a lying piece of shit. That above my comment is his original comment, it was in this file when I got it. Dont believe him that he coded any of this shit. But even tho he is a fagg, its still nice of him to leak the source for free, after spending a few hundred Dollars for it again on Matthew to get it. So thats actually really nice of him, to waste his money just to leak it. So thanks RainReach, you really weird guy. 
Its also nice from "Zeam" some PS3 modder, to give RME to Mathew originally. Without him I wouldnt have had the chance to play around with all this shit. So also thanks to that guy. 
And obviously thanks to Matthew for not protecting the CE good enough. 
And if he EVER reads this; this code is so damn aids to read. Specially when it comes to drawing the offhost itself. Its so damn aids man, why couldnt you paste something better together? Man, I really pitty you for dealing with this sort of shit for months. I hope that the source from Shield OffHost isnt just as bad as this. I mean that would explain why you never made more options for it, other then improvements. I mean that, and money. I guess money really was the main reason.
